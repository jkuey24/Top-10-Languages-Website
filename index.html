It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.[3]"><h2><span>Ruby on Rails</span></h2></a>

Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language.
